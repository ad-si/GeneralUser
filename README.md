# GeneralUser

This is a friendly fork of the FluidSynth version of the [GeneralUser GS](http://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php) soundfont originally developed by [S. Christian Collins](http://schristiancollins.com).

The FluidSynth version is tweaked for maximum compatibility when used with FluidSynth or Qsynth (which uses FluidSynth as its backend).
FluidSynth version 1.0.9 or later is recommended as earlier versions will not reproduce all of the instruments accurately.
